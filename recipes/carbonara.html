    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>100g pancetta</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>50g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</li>
        <li>50g Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and then drain the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>>In a large skillet, cook the pancetta over medium heat until crispy. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmesan cheese until well combined.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet with pancetta to low heat. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet and toss to combine with the pancetta and garlic.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the spaghetti, tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Serve immediately with extra grated cheese on top if desired.</li>
    </ol>
