    <p>Chicken tikka masala is a popular Indian dish that consists of marinated chicken pieces cooked in a creamy tomato-based sauce. The chicken is typically marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices, then grilled or baked until tender. The sauce is made with tomatoes, cream, and a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The dish is often served with rice or naan bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, chili powder, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill or oven to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and grill or bake for 10-15 minutes, until cooked through and slightly charred.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes to the skillet and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir in the heavy cream and grilled chicken pieces. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes until the sauce is thickened and the chicken is heated through.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with rice or naan bread.</li>
