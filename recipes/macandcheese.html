    <p>A recipe for a deliciously cheesy mac and cheese!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>50g baguette, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>350g pasta (preferably macaroni)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>500ml whole milk</li>
        <li>300g cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>100g parmesan / parmigiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 200c and spread the chunks of bread on a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil</li>
        <li>Boil the pasta for five minutes less than the packet recommends and drain, putting to one side</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a saucepan along with the garlic, bringing to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce to a medium heat and add the flour</li>
        <li>Whisk until a thick paste forms, then gradually add in the milk until you have a thick roux. Keep whisking to prevent lumps.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and gradually add the cheddar cheese until melted. Return to a low heat occasionally if necessary.</li>
        <li>Add half of the parmesan, and then stir in the pasta.</li>
        <li>Scatter over the bread and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining parmesan to the top and return to the oven for five minutes, then serve!</li>
    </ol>
